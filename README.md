# Shortest Path Algorithm Visualization 

## Introduction

 - [Deployment](https://nelson-algorithm-visualizer.netlify.app/)
 - Visualize the search routines of the algorithms step by step. 
 - Different search strategies can be viewed, namly Greedy Search and Heuristic Search
 - Time performance and time complexity of the algorithms are displayed

## How to play with it ?

1. Click the name of the algorithm to visualize its search routine
2. Click the grid and drag the cursor to create obstacles.
3. Speed of illustrarion can be adjusted via Normal or Fast selector
4. Click `Clear Path` to reset the visualization
5. Click `Clear All` to reset the entire board
